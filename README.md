### This code sets up a team of specialized AI agents using the Phi framework, each with a unique role:

Sentiment Agent: Searches for news articles, analyzes sentiment, and assigns scores with citations.
### Finance Agent: Fetches financial data like stock prices and analyst recommendations, highlighting trends in a structured format.
### Analyst Agent: Reviews and synthesizes outputs from other agents, ensuring accuracy and completeness.
### Agent Team: Combines the outputs of all agents into a cohesive, well-supported response.
### The agents are prompted to analyze sentiment and financial data for companies (e.g., NVDA and MSFT) over a specific period, consolidating findings into a structured and justified analysis.
## You can add multiple agents and specify roles them and add tools then combine those agents.
